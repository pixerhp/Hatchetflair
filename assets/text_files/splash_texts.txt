#-=-=-=-#   HATCHETFLAIR AND OTHER PERSONAL:

238
314
	A peculiar feeling integer I sometimes use.
3D chunks!
=^)
	A smiley face emoticon with a nose. (Noses are neat.)
<~
	Aesthetics.
bamboo?
'B' staircase
	A reference to a game jam game named "you, the game" which I contributed art to.
	(One level had a prominent staircase made out of letter 'B' tiles.)
bats?
	I tend to like vaguely bat-ish characters, so I'm likely to add some later.
Catholic Christian!
	I am designing the game with avoiding-tempting-players-into-sin in mind.
caution: a band of wowzas is velocitating towards your location rapidly.
	I found a similar humorous splash in one of my old gdocs, inspiring this.
	(A "wowza" is an early enemy/entity concept for HF.)
creature-friends?
	The game is likely to have a variety of creaturish-sapients.
dragons?
	I will very likely add dragons in some way.
flerovian and noct!
	Words originating from previous ideas, I have my own personal definitions.
fluffy-things?
grass ropes?
	I wonder how much of the game will be inspired by those random survival YouTubers...
Hatchetflash, Flerovash, Hatchetflare, Hatchetflair??
	Inspired by how many times I've felt uncertain about the game's name.
have a wonderful day!
Ka-jackelmonoque, Quatuuvix.
	fun sounding words i thought of a while ago.
	bastardized segments of trying to pronounce the alphabet as one word.
oh- hello!~♪
picks are great for breaking up hard ground.
	A break from the more stereotypical use of picks, mining through solid stone.
(probably) not a horror game. =)
	=)
sands, deserts, beaches?
	although they aren't in the game yet, stuff like that would be lovely to have if executed well.
:sparkles:
	A discord emote I commonly use in message reactions.
sticks and strawberries
	A splash from my first coding attempt at an older concept of HF. 
that lovely azure color between blue and purple?
	A color I tend to like.
that lovely rose color slightly-magenta-shifted from red?
	A color I tend to like.
to combat or not to combat...
	I have been struggling significantly with how much the game should have combat and how so.
	References Shakespeare's Hamlet, "to be, or not to be".
unincorporated!
	Unrelatedly, I want development for this game to stay away from anything which by-design puts money first.
wood-ash cement?


#-=-=-=-#   CODING & OTHER DEVELOPERS:

bojler eladó
	“boiler for sale” in hungarian, a popular hungarian meme phrase. (SteveMC32)
declaring and initializing a punch to the face!
	humorous code-themed sentence.
Hello, World!
SOUND TEST: MONO OR STEREO?
	Inspired by some old SNES games giving you stated audio options.
	References how some games have a "sound test" area which lets you listen to various game audio.


#-=-=-=-#   LIMINAL / ASREMIC / DREAM-LIKE / STRANGE:

accidentally went down too many stairs and ended up in "second-basement"...
get out of bounds.
remember an area you see every day but which you haven't properly looked at in years.
you open a closet but it's actually a new room which is a weird dusty furnitureless reflection of the other room...


#-=-=-=-#   MATHEMATICS / GEOMETRY / PHYSICS / CHEMISTRY:

But is air resistance really negligible?
	Air resistance is almost always considered negligable in physics questions.
everyone always forgets about nickel, beryllium, and other elements, BUT I DIDN'T
has anyone seen my tesseracts?
	A pun on potentially losing where a tesseract might be if you only see a 3D slice of a 4D world.
	Also a reference to the phrase: "has anyone seen my car keys?"
hexagons are the bestagons!
	incidental reference to CGP Grey, who I don't know much about.
	originally added just because I'd randomly heard the phrase and I generally like hexagons.
i^2 = -1
icosahedrons are so pretty!
please use the word "quantum" correctly.
rhombic dodecahedrons!
	I may use a "marching rhombic dodecahedrons" algorithm for terrain.
tau > pi
	I recognize tau as the circle constant and pi as the semicircle constant, despite pi's reputation.
	A pun on 6.28... being literally greater than the number 3.14...
	(Happy tau day!)
Weaire–Phelan structure?
	A tileable 3D shape which has the most volume-per-surface area when tesselated.


#-=-=-=-#   MISCELLANEOUS:

draw what you see, not what you think you see.
	fairly good art advice.
go do your homework!
go take care of yourself: drink water, eat if you should.
