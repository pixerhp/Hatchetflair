#-=-=-=-#   HATCHETFLAIR SPECIFIC AND PERSONAL:

238
314
	A peculiar feeling integer I sometimes use.
3D!
=^)
	A smiley face emoticon with a nose. (Noses are neat.)
<~
	Aesthetics; to me it looks like a flower of sorts.
bamboo and woods?
'B' staircase
	A reference to a game jam game named "you, the game" which I contributed art to.
	(One level had a prominent staircase made out of letter 'B' tiles.)
bats?
	I tend to like vaguely bat-ish characters, so I'm likely to add some later.
Catholic Christian!
	I am designing the game with avoiding-tempting-players-into-sin in mind.
caution: a band of wowzas is velocitating towards your location rapidly.
	I found a similar humorous splash in one of my old gdocs, inspiring this.
	(A "wowza" is an early enemy/entity concept for HF.)
creature-friends?
	The game is likely to have a variety of creaturish-sapients.
dragons?
	I will very likely add dragons in some way.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.
	I don't know if my game could even be considered worthy of having this as a splash,
	but I would rather remind people of Mary and asking her to pray for us than not.
fluffiness?
grass ropes?
	I wonder how much of the game will be inspired by those random survival YouTubers...
Hatchetflash, Flerovash, Hatchetflare, Hatchetflair??
	Inspired by how many times I've felt uncertain about the game's name.
have a wonderful day!
have lotsa fun!
Ka-jackelmonoque, Quatuuvix.
	fun sounding words i thought of a while ago.
	bastardized segments of trying to pronounce the alphabet as one word.
lab capsules, researchers, artificial environments?
oh- hello!~♪
picks are great for breaking up hard ground.
	A break from the more stereotypical use of picks, mining through solid stone.
(probably) not a horror game. =)
	=)
Put on your armor.
sands, deserts, beaches?
	although they aren't in the game yet, stuff like that would be lovely to have if executed well.
:sparkles:
	A discord emote I commonly use in message reactions.
sticks and strawberries
	A splash from my first coding attempt at an older concept of HF. 
swamps and asremia?
that lovely azure color between blue and purple?
	A color I tend to like.
that lovely rose color slightly-magenta-shifted from red?
	A color I tend to like.
to combat or not to combat...
	I have been struggling significantly with how much the game should have combat and how so.
	References Shakespeare's Hamlet, "to be, or not to be".
unincorporated!
	Unrelatedly, I want development for this game to stay away from anything which by-design puts money first.
wings of shadow, hearts of flerovia, tears of dreams?
wood-ash cement?


#-=-=-=-#   CODING & OTHER DEVELOPERS:

bojler eladó
	“boiler for sale” in hungarian, a popular hungarian meme phrase. (SteveMC32)
declaring and initializing a punch to the face!
	humorous code-themed sentence.
HELLO, WORLD.
SOUND TEST: MONO OR STEREO?
	Inspired by some old SNES games giving you stated audio options.
	References how some games have a "sound test" area which lets you listen to various game audio.


#-=-=-=-#   LIMINAL / ASREMIC / DREAM-LIKE / STRANGE:

accidentally went down too many stairs and ended up in "second-basement"...

do you hear the water beyond the wall of trees?
get out of bounds.
i hear the birds singing by the flowers outside.
remember an area which you see every day that you haven't properly looked at in years.
the pool under the hotel pool
the room above your attic
windows which are blank-white until you look through them
you open a closet, but it's actually just a dusty emptier mirrored-version of the room behind you...


#-=-=-=-#   MATHEMATICS / GEOMETRY / PHYSICS / CHEMISTRY:

1/0 = argument-less infinity?
But is air resistance really negligible?
	Air resistance is almost always considered negligable in physics questions.
everyone always forgets about nickel, beryllium... but i didn't!
Has anyone seen my tesseracts?
	References the phrase "has anyone seen my car keys?".
	(It'd also be pretty easy to lose a tesseract if you can only see a 3D slice of a 4D world.)
hexagons are the bestagons!
	incidental reference to CGP Grey, who I don't know much about.
	originally added just because I'd randomly heard the phrase and I generally like hexagons.
i^2 = -1
icosahedrons are so pretty!
tau > pi
	I recognize tau as the circle constant and pi as the semicircle constant, despite pi's reputation.
	A pun on 6.28... being literally greater than the number 3.14...
	(Happy tau day!)
tell the audience to please use the word "quantum" correctly.
Weaire–Phelan structure?
	A tileable 3D shape which has the most volume-per-surface area when tesselated.
Why is my room filled with rhombic dodecahedrons?


#-=-=-=-#   MISCELLANEOUS:

be strong enough to do the little things.
consider perceiving what you see rather than what you think you see.
	based on the art advice: "draw what you see, not what you think you see."
do something helpful for someone and then never mention it or bring it up.
go do your homework!
go take care of yourself. drink water, eat if you should...
