#-=-=-=-#   HATCHETFLAIR AND OTHER PERSONAL:

238
	A peculiar number.
314
	An integer I like, and (as 3:14) an interesting time of decision.
=^)
	A smiley I occassionally use. (I like having a nose.)
<~
	It looks pretty and sorta flowerish.
bamboo is a very versatile resource
'B' staircase
	A reference to a game jam game named "you, the game" I contributed to.
	(One of the levels had a prominent staircase made out of tiles which were literally the letter "B".)
bats!
Catholic Christian!
	i am designing the game with avoiding-tempting-players-into-sin in mind.
caution: a band of wowzas is velocitating towards your location rapidly.
	A similar humorous splash was in one of my old documents for splash ideas,
	a wowza is a very old enemy/entity concept for the game.
creature-friends?
	The game is likely to have a large variety of creaturish-sapients.
Cubic chunks!
	Cubic chunks allow for extremely deep/tall worlds.
dragons?
	there will probably eventually be dragons/dragonoids in the game.
flerovian and noct!
	words i generally like and use to describe certain flavors of my fantasy themed ideas.
	also references provious game/other ideas, like "Lands of Fleradove".
fluffy-things?
grass ropes?
Hatchetflash, Hatchetflare, Hatchetflair or other?
	I've felt uncertain about the game's name on multiple occasions.
hello! have a lovely day! ~PHP
	PHP stands for Pixer H Pinecone.
Ka-jackelmonoque, Quatuuvix.
	fun sounding words i thought of a while ago.
	bastardized segments of trying to pronounce the alphabet as one word.
picks are great for breaking up hard ground.
	A break from the more stereotypical use of picks, mining through solid stone.
(probably) not a horror game. =)
	It would be easy. =)
sands, deserts and beaches?
	although they aren't in the game yet, stuff like that would be lovely to have if executed well.
:sparkles:
	I commonly react to things with a sparkle emoji. (what, it's fun!)
sticks and strawberries
	A classic splash from my first coding attempt at this game. 
	The question mark, similar to other splashes, is because that content isn't currently in the game.
that lovely azure color between blue and purple?
	A color I tend to like.
that lovely rose color slightly-magenta-shifted from red?
	A color I tend to like.
to combat or not to combat, that is the question...
	Design-wise, I have been struggling with how significant the combat in this game should be for a long time.
	Also a reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet, specifically: "to be, or not to be"
unincorporated!
	corporations built to have making money as their main goal. I would like to avoid that for this game.
wood-ash cement?


#-=-=-=-#   CODING & OTHER DEVELOPERS:

bojler eladó
	“boiler for sale” in hungarian, a popular hungarian meme phrase. (SteveMC32 is Hungarian.)
declaring and initializing a punch to the face!
	humorous code-themed sentence.
SOUND TEST: MONO OR STEREO?


#-=-=-=-#   LIMINAL / ASREMIC / DREAM-LIKE / STRANGE:

accidentally went down too many stairs and ended up in "second-basement"...
	remnicient of dream-like logic and similar liminal feelings.
Get out of bounds.
when you open a closet but it's actually a new room which is a weird dusty furnitureless reflection of the other room...
	dream-like logic and liminal-space-esque-ness.


#-=-=-=-#   MATHEMATICS / GEOMETRY / PHYSICS / CHEMISTRY:

But is air resistance really negligible?
	Air resistance is almost always considered negligable in physics questions.
everyone always forgets about nickel, beryllium, and other elements, BUT I DIDN'T
have you seen my tesseracts?
	Tesseracts are the 4D analogue to cubes, and I think they're neat.
	A pun on potentially losing where a tesseract might be if you only see a 3D slice of a 4D world.
hexagons are the bestagons!
	incidental reference to CGP Grey, who I don't know much about.
	originally added just because I'd randomly heard the phrase and I generally like hexagons.
i^2 = -1
icosahedrons are so pretty!
rhombic dodecahedrons!
	I may use a "marching rhombic dodecahedrons" algorithm for terrain.
tau > pi
	Tau should be seen as the circle constant and pi as the semicircle constant. Happy tau day!
	Also a pun on 6.28... > 3.14... literally being a true statement mathematically.
Weaire–Phelan structure?
	A tileable 3D shape which has the most volume-per-surface area when tesselated.


#-=-=-=-#   MISCELLANEOUS:

draw what you see, not what you think you see.
	fairly good art advice.
go do your homework!
