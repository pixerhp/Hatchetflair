## What is Hatchetflair?
Hatchetflair is 3D sandbox survival game, currently very early in development.

Some planned content and feel of the game:
- Being able to play as and interact with characters of diverse sapient species.
- Some focus on social aspects, including talking with proximity chat, gestures and emotes (both individual and multi-character ones), etc.
- A focus on materials, processing and building (many metals and alloys, more complex tree functionality and log processing, chemicals and food stuff, etc.)
- Pseudo-infinity tall, deep and wide worlds (utilizing cubic chunks), filled with tons of biomes and entities.
- High content variety (vastly ranging rarity, difficulty, shape/size, etc. of everything).
- Some biome environments may slowly warp and regenerate themselves over time (unless the roots of the regeneration are destroyed), allowing for repeated adventures and materials extraction from them after they're given time to recover.
- An expected gameplay loop of alternating between higher-intensity gameplay (like adventuring in dangerous environments for resources, managing unexpected happenings), and more relaxing gameplay (like processing resources and building, cooking and eating meals together, etc.)

Roughly expected gameplay:
- Early-game: Struggling to survive in a wild environment (probably dying several times, and dying is harsh), gradually accumulating helpful assets to help you survive better. You may be throwing random scavenged things together for food, and may encounter other sapients for the first time.
- Mid-game: More stably living with some infrastructure setup, probably with a home base and potentially also with an NPC friend or two, but now craving materials largely found in much more dangerous places for further development. You may prepare for and start expeditioning into places teeming with greater hazards and threatening lifeforms, probably dying several times as you make discoveries and lay down helpful infrastructure.
- Late-game: More comfortable living using advanced tech and infrastructure. Along with your closer friends, there may be small towns of NPCs with specialized professions. You'll probably continue returning to already explored regenerating areas for more resources, and may now occasionally explore mysterious yet-even-more-dangerous biomes for valuables/exotics.
