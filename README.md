## What is Hatchetflair?
Hatchetflair is an ambitious 3D sandbox survival game, currently very early in development.

### Planned content and feel of the game:
- A focus on fun character/entity designs, and social interactions between players and with NPCs.
  - You can both play as and interact with characters of various sapient species, currently planned to include humans, flerovians, smilies, egrens, amalgamates, jargins, droids, and bonnits.
  - You can sit, lay down, sleep, dance (etc) most anywhere, and can also perform some emotes with others (high-fiving, hugging, etc).
  - Creatures/entities will take inspiration from various sources, range from little bugs to massive behemoths, be of flesh to robots to abstract constructs, etc.
- A focus on materials and material science.
  - An original list of chemical elements, including both more familiar ones (ferrium which similar to iron, carbonium which is similar to carbon, etc) and more original ones (digodium, veronium, collosium, etc).
  - Lots of tools, machinery and infrastructure that let you turn things into other things, such as turn woods into woodchips or sawdust, do redox reactions between metals, create fertilizer with sulfuric acid, process both solid and liquid foodstuffs, etc.
  - Liquids preserve their volume, can be stored in various containers, can interact with some machinery and crafting, and can be transported through piping.
  - Some materials are much rarer and/or more valuable than others (such as precious metals, exotic woods and organic materials), and may be fun to collect, accumulate, build with and buy/sell.
- Moderate-to-high game difficulty.
  - The game's target audience is roughly young-adults-to-adults that've had experience playing games before, and the game should (defaultly) be difficult comparable to games like *Rain World* or *Hollow Knight: Silksong*.
    - Its difficulty should *not* involve things like button-mashing or other strenuous gameplay.
    - Regardless of defaults, gameplay difficulty can be adjusted via world and character settings.
  - Surviving on your own in the wild with no starting equipment or infrastructure should be very dangerous, probably resulting in many deaths. Living in a small community (or even with just a friend) though should be comparably less dangerous.
  - There will always be at least some critically-dangerous biomes/entities in the world, even by end-game.
- Other notes:
  - Some biomes/environments may lend themselves well to temporary expeditions where you need to manage your supplies.
  - There will be fundamentals like faze (usage comparable to spells in *Secret of Mana* / *Secret of Evermore* or the beams in *Super Metroid*), gamma (associated with space/position/teleportation), digamma (associated with gravity), gray (associated with matter and composition), and mursa.
    - Some species/technologies may utilize or interact with some fundamentals but not others.
  - Characters spawning and respawning will probably be canon to how the world of hearth works.
