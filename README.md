## What is Hatchetflair?
Hatchetflair is a 3D sandbox survival game, currently very early in development.

### Planned content and feel of the game:
- A focus on fun character/entity designs and social interactions.
  - You can both play as and interact with NPCs of several sapient species, currently including humans, flerovians, smilies, egrens, amalgamates, jargins, droids, and bonnits.
  - You can do things like sit, lay down, sleep, dance or act other emotes most anywhere, and also do some emotes in conjunction with others (such as high-fiving, hugging, etc).
  - Entities in the world inspired from a swath of sources (definitely including from Super Metroid and Secret of Mana), ranging from little bugs to massive behemoths, animals to robots to abstract constructs, just generally as much fun variety as I can muster.
- A focus on materials and material science.
  - Plenty of original elements, substances, woods, organic materials (etc) that you can play and build with (such as inspired by Roblox Lumber Tycoon 2 or Roblox Oaklands), some which are quite rare/exotic and fun to collect.
  - Lots of tools, machinery and infrastructure that let you turn things into other things. (Wood into woodchips or sawdust, redox reactions between metals, creating fertilizer with sulfuric acid, processing of both solid and liquid foodstuffs, etc etc.)
- High difficulty and danger in the world.
  - Surviving on your own in the wild with no starting equipment or infrastructure should be very difficult, and may result in many deaths before your accumulated advancements can help you survive by much. (Note that living in a small community, or even just a friend, is typically much safer than surviving alone.)
  - Some environments may be very difficult to make settlements but have interesting resources, lending themselves to temporary expeditions where you need to manage your supplies.
  - The difficulty of environments ranges dramatically, with the rare most dangerous ones being essentially a death sentence to even a group of experienced players with end-game content, and thus there will always be at least some danger and mystery to be had in the world.
