# Hatchetflair (Godot)
The official repository for the game "Hatchetflare". Hatchetflare is a 3D cubic-chunk sandbox with destructable marching-cubes terrain which has a focus in mining & resource management, idea-provoking 3D world generation & exploration, being filled to the brim with fantastical creature designs (including ugly ones too,) and fun social interaction.

If you're interested in learning more about the game or potentially helping out it's development, you can see this google doc for more info: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLPusB7MNbXRBAH9oUUa8hkMpNgSxWFHCYIRtaPZ9FI/edit?usp=sharing
