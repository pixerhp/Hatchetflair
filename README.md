## What is Hatchetflair?
Hatchetflair is a 3D sandbox survival game currently very early in development.

[[WIP]]

### Currently planned content and feel of the game:
- A focus on materials and material science.
- A focus on fun character designs and social interactions.
  - You can both play as and interact with NPCs of several sapient species, currently including humans, flerovians, smilies, egrens, amalgamates, jargins, droids, and bonnits.
  - You can do things like sit, lay down, sleep, dance or act other emotes most anywhere.
- High difficulty and the feel of slow gradual progression.
